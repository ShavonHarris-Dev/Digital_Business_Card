      <p>
      I&apos;m passionate about learning languages and exploring new cultures through travel. I love mentoring career changers, helping others find their path, and giving back to my family and community. In my free time, you&apos;ll often find me reading, gardening, dancing and can&apos;t forget Karaoke! No matter what i&apos;m doing , I find joy in activities that inspire growth and connection.
