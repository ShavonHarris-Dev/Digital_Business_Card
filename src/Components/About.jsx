            <p>
            I&rsquo;m a frontend developer who&rsquo;s diving deeper into APIs and backend work. I&rsquo;ve spent the last couple of years building accessible, user-friendly web applications with React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and recently started expanding my toolkit with Python. I like tackling tough problems, collaborating with teams, and sharing what I&rsquo;ve learned. What&rsquo;s important to me is that the things I build solve real problems or bring joy to a world that can sometimes feel heavy.
