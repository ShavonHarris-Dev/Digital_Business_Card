            <p>
            I'm a frontend developer who’s diving deeper into APIs and backend work. I’ve spent the last couple of years building accessible, user-friendly web applications with React, JavaScript, and TypeScript, and recently started expanding my toolkit with Python. I like tackling tough problems, collaborating with teams, and sharing what I’ve learned. What’s important to me is that the things I build solve real problems or bring joy to a world that can sometimes feel heavy.
